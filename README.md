# Human behavior and automated driving features

### Goal

Learn basic survey data analysis through hands-on experience with the State of the State Survey (SOSS)

### Schedule

**Week 1** (May 31- June 2): **Identifying relevant variables to include in a model**

Question: 

1.	In theory, what factors (including sociodemographic factors) may or may not explain acceptance of driver assistance technologies?
2.	In theory, what factors (including sociodemographic factors) may or may not explain interests in owning or leasing self-driving vehicles?

Task: 

1.	Review and summarize existing literature on these topics to answer the above questions. e.g. Acceptance of the advanced driver assistance systems applications does not depend on people’s characteristics, including age, driving experience, gender, or frequency of navigation device usage (source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15472450.2012.716646).

**Week 2** (June 3- 9): **Preparing data for analysis**

Task:

1.	Load and clean the SOSS data; get familiar with it
2.	Generate a table of sample statistics (with weights preferably)

**Week 3** (June 10- 16): **Analyzing acceptance of driver assistance technologies**

Question: 

1.	How comfortable are Michiganders with driver assistance technologies?
2.	Are there any differences in Michiganders’ comfortability with driver assistance technologies among different demographics?

Task: 

1.	Descriptively analyze driving18, driving19, driving20, and driving21 to answer question 1
2.	Model driving18, driving19, driving20, and driving21 with variables identified in Week 1 to answer question 2 (use logistic regressions or other models that you think make sense)

---

**Week 4** (June 17- 23): **Analyzing driving behavior change due to automated features**

Question: 

1.	How likely are Michiganders to change their driving behaviors if their vehicles have collision avoidance system (i.e. alert drivers of the risk of a collision and assist them by automatically braking or steering to avoid it)?
2.	How likely are Michiganders to change their driving behaviors if their vehicles do not have collision avoidance system but others do?
3.	Have Michiganders heard of self-driving vehicles?
4.	How interested are Michiganders in owning or leasing a completely self-driving vehicle in the future? Any sociodemographic difference?

Task:

1.	Analyze driving22, driving23, driving16, driving17 with similar techniques learned in Week 3 to answer the above questions

---

**Week 5** (June 24- July 4): **Write-up**

Task: 

1.	Organize and write up findings from previous weeks according to Eva’s paper structure
